MultLdr is a tool that enables users to generate payload loaders that can be used to load and execute payloads in memory. The tool is designed to be used in conjunction with other tools that generate payloads, such as Metasploit, to create a stealthy way to load and execute payloads in memory and evade detection by security software.

The tool aims to be extensible and easy to use, allowing users to create custom plugins that can be used to generate payload loaders for different types of payloads. The tool is written in Python and is designed to be either run inside a docker container or on the local machine.
